## Overview

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to automate the dissemination of Python programming tips, providing a structured approach to enhancing Python skills incrementally. Here's how it works:

1. **Construct a Tip Repository**: Assemble a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) with Python programming subjects and cues for tip generation.

2. **Personalize Your Learning**: Tailor your repository with specific topics and queries aligned with your learning objectives.

3. **Tip Distribution Automation**: Modify the script to interface with your repository and set the distribution schedule.

4. **Daily Tip Reception**: Configure a cron job to execute the script routinely, delivering a new Python tip to your inbox each day.

## Key Features

- **Consistent Learning**: Daily insights into Python, covering a spectrum from fundamental data structures to advanced algorithms.
- **Tailored Content**: Curate your educational content by selecting topics that align with your personal or professional growth.
- **Seamless Automation**: Ensure uninterrupted learning with automated processes.
- **Progressive Enlightenment**: Gradual improvement of Python proficiency through a methodical and engaging learning module.

## Initial Setup

1. **Repository Cloning**: Clone this GitHub repository onto your local environment.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary Python packages.
3. **OpenAI API Configuration**: Obtain an OpenAI GPT-3 API key and integrate it into your environment settings.
4. **Tip Repository Creation**: Use the provided example spreadsheet or develop a bespoke repository with Python topics and prompts.
5. **Script Configuration**: Direct the script to your repository and schedule your learning sessions.
6. **Routine Execution**: Implement a cron job to automate the daily execution of the script.

## Operational Use

- Execute the script to initiate the generation and dispatch of a daily Python tip.
- Personalize the learning repository with chosen topics and queries.
- Schedule script execution in congruence with your local time zone.

## Deployment

The Python Daily Tips Generator is deployed on AWS Lambda and triggered by EventBridge. This ensures that the script is run regularly without manual intervention.

## System Requirements
