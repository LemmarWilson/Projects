# Python Daily Tips Generator

## Overview

This project harnesses OpenAI's GPT-3 to automate the dissemination of Python programming tips. Designed to enrich the learning experience, it introduces a structured approach to enhancing Python skills incrementally. Below is the operational blueprint:

1. **Construct a Tip Repository**: Initiate by assembling a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) with an assortment of Python programming subjects and cues for tip generation. An illustrative example is available for reference.

2. **Personalize Your Learning**: Tailor your repository with specific topics and queries aligned with your learning objectives.

3. **Tip Distribution Automation**: Modify the script to interface with your repository and set the distribution schedule.

4. **Daily Tip Reception**: Configure a cron job to execute the script routinely. Enjoy the benefit of a new Python tip delivered to your inbox each day.
