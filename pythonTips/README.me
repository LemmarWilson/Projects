# Python Daily Tips Generator

## Overview
The Python Daily Tips Generator is a Python script that sends you a daily Python programming tip via SMS. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate insightful Python tips and Twilio or AWS SNS to deliver these tips to your phone.

## Features
- Generates a daily Python programming tip.
- Supports a wide range of Python topics, including data structures, algorithms, modules, functions, error handling, object-oriented programming, data analysis, and more.
- Tips are accompanied by illustrative examples.
- Easily configurable with a spreadsheet containing topics and prompts.
- Automatically sends tips at a specified time daily.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the Python Daily Tips Generator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your OpenAI API key.
4. Create a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) containing Python programming topics and prompts for generating tips. See the example spreadsheet for guidance.
5. Update the script to point to your spreadsheet and configure the time for tip delivery.
6. Set up a cron job to run the script at your preferred time daily.

## Usage
- Run the script to generate and send a daily Python tip.
- Customize the topics and prompts in your spreadsheet to tailor the tips to your preferences.
